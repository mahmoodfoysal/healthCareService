# Live Site

 [live Site](https://healthcaresite-50992.web.app)


* This is the healthcare-related website. People can find health information.
* Developing this website we use react.js, firebase authentication, react router dom, context API, bootstrap, react-fontawesome. we also use privateRoute that's why without login people can't see service details.
* There are four routes, they are home, services, about us and FAQ. in future we add some new services about health related.
